♠️ Notice of Privacy (along with an entire dramatic monologue):

Look! Greetings from this modest corner of the Internet! Before you continue and examine my painstakingly constructed digital shrine, be aware that the "Contact," "Address," "Phone," "Email," and any other personal identifiers you may come across here are not my true, authentic, factual, government-verified information.


Why? since I respect privacy. Capital-P, full-send, put-it-in-a-vault, laser-guarded privacy, not just any privacy.

You see, I have decided to safeguard my personal information with the vigilance of a dragon hoarding gold in this day and age of cyber-espionage, data-mining goliaths, "just-give-us-your-phone-number-for-OTP" schemes, and relatives who inquire as to why you haven't gotten married yet.

Therefore, the contact information you see here is a complex mirage, dear recruiter/hacker/old-friend-stalking-me-from-2013.
